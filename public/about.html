<h1>About Me</h1>
Hi, I'm Oladimeji Owoyemi from lagos Nigeria.<br> 
I'm a web developer/ Programmer in the making. It has been a great experience since I started this journey and I don't regret embarking on this journey. I have a whole long way to go and I hope and pray God helps me with this journey because I still have a long way to go and I'm not going and never planning to back down anytime no matter the challenges I come across.<p>I pray this path that I embark on makes a very great and important person in life and I pray it worth all the stress, time, money, resources and sacrifices I've sacrificed to be a successful Developer either and I pray I achieve so many things in the Tech Space.</p>
